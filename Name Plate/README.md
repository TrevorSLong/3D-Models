## **Description**
This is a system designed for maximum customization in making your own 3d name plate! Use my pre-made parts, make your own, or use the communities (hopefully you all make some :) ).

 

This system allows you to control the color and style of each individual letter, the color and style of the stand, and so much more then that! I've provided dimensions so you all can make this system your own!

## **Example Print**

## **Types of Letters**
- **Print finish**
  - Print finish letters have the readable surface of the letter as the top layer in the 3d print. This gives it a very 3D printed look. This example is a print finish because the surface facing away from us is what touches the print bed (no supports if the little edge faces up).

- **Bed Finish**
  - This letter is a bed finish print since the readable side of the letter was touching the bed during printing (the side facing you). This could look cool if you have a textured bed since the print won't have the 3D printed look. It's totally preference.

## **Detailed Example of the Types of Finishes**

## **Letter Fonts**
- Bed-Finish Century Schbk Letters
  - These letters are bed finish and in the font Century Schbk Bold Itali
- Print-Finish Ariel Rounded Letters
  - These letters are print finish and in the font Ariel Rounded bold.

## **Stand Types**
All stands have end caps and middle pieces. They slot together using little printable pegs that go into the holes. The letters usually overlap the gaps which also helps hold them in place.
- **Single Rail Stand**
  - This stand can hold one row of letters or one row of background pieces.
  - The “Trevor Long” tag I printed for myself uses these stands.

- **Dual Rail Stand**
  - This stand has two identical rails, this can be used for either two rows of letters, two rows of backgrounds, or one row of letters and one row of backgrounds.
  - For example the “Jason” name tag picture uses this stand with one row of letters and one row of backgrounds.
  - If you share a desk you could use this for a two sided name tag where each side shows a different name

## **Spacers**
Spacers come in various sizes and can be used to space out letters, words, or backgrounds.

## **Backgrounds**
Background pieces mount into the stand rails and allow for a background to be placed behind your name. I have only provides a slanted background but I'm sure you could make some awesome backgrounds

## **Overall Assembly Example**
This image shows how everything fits together using a transparent stand.

## **Dimensions**
My goal is to make this system super modular so that the community and yourself can create additional stands, fonts, and backgrounds! Here are the dimensions for the groove and the inserts into the groove:

## **Print Settings and Final Notes**
The parts fit together more easily if everything is PLA, that being said I had no issues putting PETG letters into a PLA stand. These are loose recommendations since these are easy parts to print:
- Layer height: 0.20mm Quality
- Infill: 10% Gyroid
- Supports: None

## **Naming Scheme**
- SR = Single rail
- DR = Dual rail
- -XXX = Size in inches
- **Example:** SR-150 is a single rail stand that is 1.5" long

*I hope you enjoy these prints! Please feel free to make add on's compatible with this system and re-post them! It would be awesome if community created fonts, stands, and backgrounds made this system amazing! My goal is to create more in the future but right now I'm very limited on time. Happy printing!*
