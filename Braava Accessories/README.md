My Braava Jet M6 would frequently wedge itself between the couch and the floor and get stuck, making it unable to complete any job. These 3d printed parts extend the height of the robot so that it doesn't do this anymore.

The front extensions are designed to be attached to the bumper with 3M command strips. They make it so that the robot will feel furniture and not go under it. 

The rear extensions haven't proven to be necessary, so you can probably skip printing those. They are also attached with command strips but you need to cut them to make them fit without sticking out.
