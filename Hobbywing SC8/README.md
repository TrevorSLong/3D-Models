This is a super simple adapter plate that mimics the one that comes with the Hobbywing EZRUN WP SC8 ESC. The original plate allows the ESC to be mounted into a Traxxas car like a Slash, Rustler, etc. 

 

This plate serves exactly the same function but it is slightly thicker and stronger to help prevent the cracking that sometimes occurs on the original plate (mine in the picture is doing this).
