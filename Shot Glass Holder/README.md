## **Description**

This is a modular system to help you display your shot glasses! There are various diameter stands you can mix and match to help hold the glasses more securely. Each glasses stand is printed individually and then snaps together with connectors.

## **Stands**

There are a few different options, the 1-43_tall nomenclature means 1.43 inches in diameter and its one of the tall ones. I recommend measuring the bottom of the glass with calipers and choosing a stand with a diameter slightly bigger. 

## **Connectors**
The connectors connect each one of the individual glass stands together. The system is designed to have one row of short stand in the front and one row of tall stands in the back.

The *“connector-row”* file is used to connect the stands in each row together. For example, it connects one short stand to another short stand. It also connects the tall stands together.

the *“connector-column”* file is a connector that connects the front row to the back row. 

## **Caps**
The caps are designed to fill unused connector holes. There are a couple different types:

*“cap-corner”* cap off the corners of the tall glass stands.

*“cap-large”* caps off the connector hole on the front of the tall glass stands (fills connector-column holes).

*“cap-small”* caps off the holes left by “connector-row” so this works on the ends of the tall stand or the ends of the short stands.
