## Description
This mug stand is designed to allow two rows of mugs to be displayed without worrying that the mug could fall off.

It holds the mug in by using a lip that holds the bottom edge so that its less likely it could be knocked off (by a cat for example). It also has optional areas for 3/8" felt pads and weights if desired. 

The lip at the top is designed to hold a Starbucks Been There mug, but any mug where that lower edge is less then 3.65" will work. For added security on mugs that aren't used, you could use 3M strips to hold the mug to the stand (only on V1 unless you glue the cap to the top of V2).

## V1

You don't need the cap for this one. Both versions are exactly the same shape from the outside. V1 just has a hole “drilled” in from the bottom for weights. This would mean the weights need to be glued in.

## V2

V2 is shaped more like a vase because its opening if from the top. This allows you to fill it with weight (something like sand) and not need to worry about gluing. It also has an optional cap that can cap off the top cavity. V2 takes about 40 minutes longer to print and uses about the same amount of material. Its more a matter of preference.
Print settings

    Material: I recommend PETG for structural items
    Infill: 30% (This is plenty strong but going higher would make the stand heavier)
