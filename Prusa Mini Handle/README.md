## **Description**

This is a simple, yet durable, handle for the Prusa Mini. It was designed to match the David Warboss Mini Base. It attaches to the Z axis using screws and t-slot nuts.

## **Print Instructions**

I was able to print this handle with no support material, but the surface finish did suffer a bit on the bottom and in the holes for the screws. You could try either way, but the included GCode is no supports, otherwise I recommend:
- Layer Height: 0.15mm
- Infill: 30%
- Supports: Either way but I didn't use them

## **Materials**
In order to attached these you need some t-slot nuts and screws. I used:
- [3030 Series T-Slot Nut M6](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P1PMZSM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [M6 x 12mm Button Head Screw](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GWTMRX3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
