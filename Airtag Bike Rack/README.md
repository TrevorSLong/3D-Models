This is a Airtag holder I designed for my rear bike rack. I specifically have the Bontrager Deluxe MIK (this is the one in stock at my local Trek store) but this should work for anything where the poles are about .45" (11.43mm) in diameter and about 3.3" (83.82mm) apart.

 

You will need 6 M3 nuts and screws to secure the top and bottom together.
