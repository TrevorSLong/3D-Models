## **Description**

Hello everyone! Here I have made a drop in replacement for the Traxxas battery hinge piece as well as some extended options to help fit some larger batteries in. I know this works on the Rustler 4x4 and Slash 4x4 but its possible it works on other Traxxas cars also.

 

The drop in replacement is “traxxasbatteryhinge” all of the ones with “plusXX" refers to how much taller it is. For example the plus10 is .10" taller then the original.
